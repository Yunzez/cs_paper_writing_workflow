# cs_paper_writing_workflow

This repository hosts a five-stage LLM-assisted workflow for drafting a CS research paper. Start with `workflow/README.md` for an overview, and consult the stage-specific guides in `workflow/` when prompting the assistant. Draft sections live under `paper/sections/`, while intermediary artifacts (outlines, reviews, checklists) live in `paper/drafts/`. Populate `paper/metadata/references.bib` before running Stage 2 so the related work summaries can be generated automatically.
